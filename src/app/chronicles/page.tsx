              The worship of Shree Mahalasa Narayani Devi has ancient roots dating back centuries. 
              According to temple chronicles, the Goddess was originally located in Nepal during Kaliyuga, 
              then moved to Aurangabad in Maharashtra during periods of religious upheaval.

            <p>
              During the Mughal domination, the sacred idol was moved to a secret location in Goa 
              for protection. The Portuguese conquest later caused the Goddess to be relocated from 
              Verna to Mardol, where devotees could continue their worship safely.

              Historical documents reveal that Bhagwan Parshuram brought 10 Saraswat Brahmin families 
              from Trihotra in the north to Gomantak (Goa). The families following Mhalsa Devi 
              established themselves in Varunapur, known today as Verna.

              The temple at Old Mardol (Velham or Verna) in Salcette was destroyed by the Portuguese 
              in 1567 during the forcible Christianization campaign. However, the sacred icon was 
              rescued by devoted followers who risked their lives to preserve their faith.

            <p>
              When the current temple in Mardol was constructed in the 17th century, the sacred icon 
              was reconsecrated according to Vedic rites. This marked a new chapter in the temple's 
              history, ensuring the continuity of worship and devotion.

              The foundation of modern temples was laid with proper astrological timing. At the 
              Konchady temple in Mangalore, the foundation was laid on Magha Bahula Chaturthi, 
              February 9, 1985, at 12:19 PM during Vrishabha Lagna by His Holiness Srimad 
              Sudheendra Theertha Swamiji.

            <p>
              The chronicles of Mahalasa temples across different regions tell a remarkable story 
              of faith preservation. During Portuguese persecution in Goa, many devotee families 
              migrated to places like Basrur in Dakshina Kannada, Mangalore, and other coastal areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              These migrations led to the establishment of numerous Mahalasa temples across the 
              western coast of India, each carrying forward the sacred traditions and maintaining 
              the spiritual connection with the divine mother.

              Today, Shree Mahalasa Narayani temples continue to serve as centers of spiritual 
              learning and cultural preservation. The temples maintain ancient rituals while 
              adapting to modern needs of devotees worldwide.

              The chronicles serve as a testament to the unwavering faith of devotees who,
