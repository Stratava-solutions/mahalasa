              Nowadays, as the thirst for spirituality arises, many people,
              among them our own community members, are lost when it comes to
              knowing who a true Guru is. I have seen them attending the
              discourses of many so-called Gurus, who later tremendously
              disappoint them and such people then lose faith in our religion.
              <br />
              A close family friend, the progeny of a priest’s family of a major
              GSB temple in Dakshina Kannada, became a follower of Asaram bapu.
              Asaram got into trouble and most of his followers quickly deserted
              him.
              <br />
              Secondly, many consider our GSB Swamijis as Gurus. They are our
              Samaj leaders, rather than Guru in the true sense.
              <br />
              Then who is a Guru? While Vidya’s link provides many answers, yet
              allow me to relate my own experience.
              <br />
              I never realised the importance of searching for a Guru, leave
              alone the importance of one. I concentrated on service to my
              Kuladevata, Shri Mahalasa Narayani and got the opportunity to
              serve Her through http://www.mahalasa.org, the website that I
              launched more than a decade ago.
              <br />
              Born and brought up in Bombay, my professional career as a
              journalist took me Hyderabad and Dubai. After being in Hyderabad
              for several years, I had decided to settle down there and
              accordingly purchased two-three plots.
              <br />
              Also, during the course of my career, I was introduced to many
              “gurus”, spiritual quacks, tantriks, etc. Many of them seemed to
              be genuine, but I never got attached to any of them. Even then, I
              did not realise the need for any Guru.
              <br />
              But Mahalasa amma had Her own ideas for my future. Thus developed
              the idea in my mind of settling down not in a big city, but a
              small rural surroundings.
              <br />
              After leaving Dubai, I got the offer of a senior position in a
              major newspaper in Bangalore; I was tempted to take it up. But the
              moment I landed in that city, I was jolted back to the idea that
              big cities were not for me, not Bangalore in any case. Hyderabad
              or Bombay were far better cities.
              <br />
              Anyway, it so happened that finally I took up a place on rent in
              Manipal. After searching high and low, I purchased a plot in
              nearby Parkala and constructed a house there.
              <br />
              Since my prime interest was Mother Mahalasa, I got the opportunity
              of visiting Shri Mahalasa Narayani Devi Kshetra at Harikhandige,
              about 22 kms from Udupi. I had visited the temple once during a
              vacation trip from Dubai in about 2002. After coming to Manipal, I
              did visit the temple several times, but could not do so on a
              regular basis.
              <br />
              During the initial visits to that temple, I saw that many people
              were falling at the feet of the Dharmadarshi of that temple, one
              Shri Suresh J. Pai, that too within the temple itself. I felt a
              bit odd, since I did not see any such scene at any other temple of
              my beloved Kuladevata. Many devotees were even calling him
              “Guruji”.

              Anyway, with whatever limited interaction I had with Shri Suresh
              Pai, I found him out to be a very down-to-earth, simple,
              soft-spoken, genial human being. Many people came to him to seek
              advice, some just to share their thoughts. Many times I found him
              in the temple campus, either with a broom in his hands, or a
              pickaxe or a shovel, always keeping himself busy with some or the
              other work.
              <br />
              It was much later that I realised that he was no ordinary human
              being, but a Guru sent by Lord Shri Mahalasa Narayani for the
              benefit of Her devotees, to show them the true path to Her
              devotion.
              <br />
              It also dawned on me that my coming down to Manipal/Parkala was no
              ordinary episode. Many small and big things started happening
              which frequently took me to Harikhandige. It was indeed our
              beloved Mother calling me. However, these calls directed me to the
              feet of Shri Suresh Pai, and on Her prompting, I have realised in
              him my true Guruji!
              <br />
              Materially, I may not be better off, but mentally I am at much
              peace now. Of course, I am but in the playschool or pre-KG, yet to
              even begin the ABCs from him.
              <br />
              Originally from Sirsi Shri Suresh J Pai had settled down in Goa
              and was a lecturer in a commerce college. He also was associated
              with the Goa GSB association and as a Mahalasa Kulavi, was a
              frequent visitor to the Mardol temple. He also led a group which
              was into bhajans and anushtans at Mardol, as well as other temples
              of Shri Mahalasa Narayani, like the one at Kumta.
              <br />
              Also, he was very much into spiritual activities and performed
              many havanas and yaags at Mardol and elsewhere frequently.
              <br />
              Around 2002, he decided to build a small community hall at a
              central location so that his group from many different places
              could regularly perform bhajans,poojas and havans etc. They got a
              place at Harikhandige for this purpose.
              <br />
              But the gracious Kuladevata wanted something more than just a
              community hall. In his dream, She directed him to construct a
              temple for Her. Thus the Shri Mahalasa Narayani Devi Kshetra came
              into being. In that scenic rural hamlet, where now many devotees
              vouch for many miracles, apart from Shri Mahalasa’s temple, also
              came up temples to Shri Hanuman, Shri Ganapati and Shri Mahadeva,
              Navagraha and Naaga.
              <br />
              Also installed were Holy Padukas of Lord Gurudatta. Soon, a
              dome-like structure came into being and within this structure, the
              padukas found a place along with a sculpture of Lord Gurudatta.
              <br />
              As the temple grew, so did Guruji’s fame. But Guruji never
              performs any miracles like other so-called Godmen. He only talks
              and advises only if asked. He is like many social reformers, who
              is against alcoholism, tobacco consumption and the like. He has
              set up a high school for local children, who otherwise have to
              travel to far off places to study. He also does not believe in the
              “Bhar” or the “Darshan” being performed at many temples and
              advices his devotees to avoid them. Ditto as regards our Swamijis.
              <br />
              Another thing about Guruji, he does not believe in soliciting
              donations. He says, since She asked the temple to be set up,
              whenever She desires, the money or material required would
              automatically come. Secondly, there is no rate card for performing
              sevas at Harikhandige. You can pay whatever you can afford.
              Because, this is not a kirana shop or a departmental store.
              <br />
              Yet, many first timers who come to Harikhandige, go back and
              transfer significant amounts without being prompted or asked for
              anything. And, they do not expect anything in return. Not even
              their names on any marble or metal plaques. These true devotees
              only serve God, not their false egos.
              <br />
              Guruji Suresh Pai came out of the adhyatmik tradition, being a
              disciple of his Guruji in Panaji, Goa. He is also an ardent
              devotee of Lord Gurudatta, the Trimurti avatar of Lords Brahma,
              Vishnu and Maheswara.
              <br />
              Many people who are into the adhyatmik tradition and have visited
              Harikhandige say that the Datta Peetha at Harikhandige emanates
              with such vibrations as seen only at Ganagapur.
              <br />
              At Harikhandige, Sundays and Thursdays are important days. Sundays
              for Shri Mahalasa Narayani and Thursdays for Lord Gurudatta.
              <br />
              Personally for me, serving my Kuladevata is the most important
              thing. But on Her directions, obeisance to Guruji has become even
              more important. Not that he has asked anything from me nor
              expected anything from anyone, except more dedication and devotion
              to Shri Mahalasa Narayani and continuous guidance to get out of
              the pitfalls of this material world. Guruji’s ultimate aim is
              guide his followers towards true spirituality and towards moksha
              from the cycle of life and death!
              <br />
              Guruji has also penned an impressive book on Shri Mahalasa
              Narayani, called “The Charitra of Goddess Shri Mahalasa Narayani”,
              which has editions in English, Marathi and Kannada. This is the
              Gita for all Kulavis of Shri Mahalasa Narayani.

              Due to reasons way beyond our control, our popular website went
              offline during the last almost 2 years.
              <br />
              Our Daily Panchang and Events e-mail, which was being received
              eagerly by a lot of subscribers, too stopped.
              <br />
              The website was attacked and the DP&E mails were getting
              repeatedly blocked. I also lost my job. I went into depression.
              <br />
              Then one day, I had to be hospitalised. For about two months. In
              the first hospital, my condition started deteriorating and late
              one night, I was shifted to the Critical Care Unit of a corporate
              hospital, where they diagnosed me as having pneumonia.
              <br />
              The next morning, the doctors said that I had suffered multi-organ
              failure and declared my condition as critical. At best, they said,
              they would keep me under observation.
              <br />
              As they put it, my heart, lungs, liver, kidneys were gone. My
              brain was functioning sub optimally. I was almost like in a coma,
              but became conscious once or twice for short periods. During once
              such period of conciousness, my wife briefed me about the
              situation and what doctors had told her. I whispered to her: “I
              want to die at home” …and then I closed my eyes.
              <br />
              Due to unemployment for a long time, there was no income. The
              hospital bills were rising alarmingly. Death would have brought us
              relief…
              <br />
              The hospital initially refused to discharge me. My wife explained
              about our financial situation and told them she wanted to take me
              to another hospital where we could get discount based on a
              community health card. They agreed. Once in the ambulance, she
              gave the driver the directions.
              <br />
              One senior doctor who had stepped out, had a doubt and looked at
              her askance. She confessed: “I am taking him home.” Tapping her on
              her back, he said: “I think you are taking a wise decision”.
              Because by then, I was reduced to being almost a vegetable and
              physically looking like a skeleton.
              <br />
              As the ambulance started, my wife made me say two words, which
              came out hoarsely as I was barely conscious:
              <br />
              <h1 className="text-red-600 text-center py-6">
                MAHALASA!
                <br />
                GURUJI!
              </h1>
              And the Ghar Wapsi commenced…
              <br />
              Once we reached home, all life-saving paraphernalia was removed
              and I was laid on the bed. All medicines given by the two previous
              hospitals were stopped.
              <br />
              All had given up hope.
              <br />
              But the Mother of this world had not. Our beloved Mother Mahalasa.
              Today, as I look back, well on the way to a full recovery, it was
              simply due to Mahalasa Amma’s sheer grace and surely due to
              Guruji’s blessings, that I survived.
              <br />
              Perhaps they had in mind that I should continue my service via the
              website, http://www.mahalasa.org in Her name and the Daily
              Panchang & Events mailer.
              <br />
              uruji told me that a lot of people had mentioned to him about how
              they were missing both the website and this DP&E mailer.
              <br />
              Many of you, dear subscribers, missed my humble offerings and
              prayed for me. My wife and I thank each one of you from the bottom
              of my heart!
              <br />
              (It was only much later that we came to know this: One of my
              wife’s cousin was told by a Vasai-based oracle that due to their
              (my wife’s and mine) services to Mahalasa Amma and Guruji Shri
              Suresh J Pai at Shri Mahalasa Narayani Devi Kshetra, Harikhandige,
              Mhalshi Amma brought me back; I had already died that day.)
              <br />
              Another incident comes to mind. As I was lying on the bed the next
              day after coming from hospital, semi-conscious, my wife took the
              cellphone and connected to Guruji. And He spoke to me. His
              mellifluous voice was the life-saving medicine that I required
              badly and which set me on the path to full recovery.
              <br />
              Here, doctors and locals claim having seen a miracle: A lot of
              people had come to see me while I was bed-ridden after being
              brought back from hospital. Today, they see me riding my scooter,
              going about errands and moving about as freely and as normally as
              before.
              <br />
              Last week Guruji told me to remove all doubts from my mind and not
              to hesitate, but go ahead with the service that I had been doing
              since 1998.
              <br />
              I had lost all my files, and the backups which I downloaded from
              the servers were all corrupted. I had to start from the scratch.
              But then the Mother had her ways and helped me along the way. In
              three days I re-created the main website http://www.mahalasa.org
              as well as the extremely popular subdomain
              http://harikhandige.mahalasa.org. Work is still on and requires a
              lot of improvisation.
              <br />
              A sudden bout of fever, cold and an almost unbearable headache
              during these three days (which was either sheer coincidence or Her
              ways to test me) could not deter me. I worked day and night.
              <br />
              And it was my wife, Rohini, who was always by my side, giving
              hope, encouraging — and always talking about Mother Mahalasa and
              Guruji — who also contributed in prompting me to begin this work
              again.
              <br />
              At the end, I must note that it was my wife’s prayers and her
              rock-solid faith in Mother Mahalasa and Guruji, that I am alive
              today. Perhaps if she did not take me out of hospital that day, I
              would surely never have come back. One day, of course, I will have
              to leave this body, but now I have to do this Seva, and I hope
              that when the end finally comes, I will attain Moksha, the
              ultimate a human being can desire.
