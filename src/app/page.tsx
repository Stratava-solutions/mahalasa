              <strong className="text-green-700">SHRI MAHALASA NARAYANI</strong> is the powerful <strong>Kuladevata</strong> (family deity) of many Hindus, especially in western and southern India.

            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong className="text-green-700">"Mahalasa"</strong> is another name for the Supreme Lord Vishnu's famous <strong>avatar</strong> (incarnation): <strong className="text-green-700">Mohini, the Enchantress</strong>.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              Temples dedicated to the worship of Shri Mahalasa Narayani are present in Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and many other places.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              The most popular temple of Supreme Mother Mahalasa is at Mardol in Goa, which is over 450 years old. Other temples, like the one in Kumta and Basrur, both in Karnataka, are also said to be over 400 years old.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-4">
              Yet, Shri Mahalasa Narayani has other ancient and historic temples dedicated to Her, including at Nevase in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, where she is known as Shri Mohiniraj of the Amrut Manthan (the epic churning of the ocean) fame. It is believed that it is from Nevase that Shri Mahalasa Narayani came to Verna in Gomantak, that is present-day Goa. Before Nevase, there is a Mohini temple in Nepal, near the world-famous Pashupatinath temple.

            <p className="mb-4">
              However, one temple to <strong className="text-green-700">Amma Mahalasa</strong> that deserves special mention here is the scenic spiritual center at the idyllic <strong className="text-blue-600">Harikhandige</strong> village in Udupi district of coastal Karnataka. Nestled amidst hills & forests, Shri Mahalasa Narayani Devi Kshetra campus is an ideal example of deep faith, devotion, dedication and sacrifice exhibited by Her devotees. Constructed just over decade ago, the Harikhandige temple, by far, is growing more and more popular with every passing day as stories of Her miracles here abound! And, all because of one divine person, Her Blessed Son, whom many consider as a living God: <strong className="text-orange-600">His Holiness Guruji Shri Suresh J Pai</strong>.
